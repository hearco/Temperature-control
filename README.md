# Temperature-control
 
This project was developed to control a heater by using and Arduino UNO, an opto-isolated triac, a LM35 sensor, a light bulb and a cover for the light bulb to conserve the temperture.
 
Software used:
- Arduino IDE
- Scilab 5.5.0

Hardware used:
- Arduino UNO
- Opto-isolated TRIAC
- A light bulb
- LM35 temperature sensor

After installing Scilab 5.5.0, consider executing the next commands in console:
- atomsInstall("arduino")
- atomsInstall("serial")
- atomsInstall("guimaker")
- atomsInstall("guibuilder")

By using both the arduino and scilab files, serial communication will be achieved.
